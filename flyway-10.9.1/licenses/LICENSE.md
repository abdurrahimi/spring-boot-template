law. The Subscription Software has been developed as a standard
product for use by a wide variety of users and so We are unable to

user\'s needs. You shall take full responsibility for ensuring that
the Subscription Software is suitable for Your intended purposes and
to facilitate investigation into such suitability, We offer a free
Evaluation Period.

- 5.3 Regardless of Clause 5.1, any Preview Software is provided \"AS

its functionality, quality, performance, suitability or fitness for
purpose. All other terms, conditions, representations and warranties
expressed or implied whether by statute or otherwise are hereby
expressly excluded, and the provisions of clauses 5.1, 5.4 and 9.2
shall not apply to the Preview Software. Further Redgate is under no
obligation to release the Preview Software as part of the Subscription
Software or any other software.

- 5.4 **Support**. In relation to and without prejudice to the
generality of clause 5.2 above, We provide support to users of
Subscription Software via Our website, user forums, by email and by
phone. The support is provided subject to the terms of this Agreement.

problems identified by You, the nature of software is such that no
guarantee can be provided that any particular problem will be solved.
You accept that, where a particular problem requires an update to the
Subscription Software, the scheduling of any new releases and the
functionality those releases contain shall be under Our sole control.

dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this agreement
or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes
or claims). Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that We

Specific Terms by You. Accordingly, We shall be entitled to
seek an injunction or other equitable relief for any threatened or
actual breach of those clauses.

faith and agree an alternative provision or part provision that
provides as closely as possible, the same commercial effect as the
original.

right, power or remedy will operate as a waiver of it, nor will any
partial exercise preclude any further exercise of the same, or of some
other right, power or remedy.

this Agreement will be enforceable by virtue of the Contracts (Rights

terms of this Agreement and have not exceeded the use that You have
paid for. Any audit may be conducted by Us or Our third party agents
during normal business hours.

of this Agreement by updating this Agreement on Our website. You are
advised to check the website periodically for notices concerning such

    service contract with Us; and (ii) to a refund for the unused
    portion, or to compensation for its reduced value. You are also
    entitled to choose a refund or replacement for major failures with

    details of how You think that the Subscription Software does not
    meet that warranty in clause 5.1.3.

        - (ii) Despite clause 6 and any other provision in this Agreement, if the
     Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (including the Australian
     Consumer Law in Schedule 2 of that Act) provides that there is a
     guarantee in relation to any good or service supplied by Us in
     connection with this Agreement, and Our liability for failing to
     comply with that guarantee cannot be excluded but may be limited,
     then clauses 6.2, 6.3 and clause 3 of Schedule 1 and any other

     the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods, or paying the cost of
